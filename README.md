## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before diving into the learning materials, ensure you have:

- ☕ **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
- 🔧 **IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code** (IDE of your choice)
- 📚 **Basic understanding of programming concepts** (helpful but not required)
- 🌐 **Git** for version control

### 📥 Installation Guide

1. **Install Java JDK:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Java is installed
   java -version
   
   # Download from Oracle or use package manager
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
   
   # macOS
   brew install openjdk@11
   
   # Windows - Download from Oracle's website
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dexter-code03/JAVA-DEV.git
cd JAVA-DEV
```

### 2. Explore the Learning Path
```
JAVA-DEV/
├── 📁 First Code/          # Your first Java programs
├── 📁 varNdataType/        # Variables and data types examples
├── 📁 #NOTES/              # Educational PDF resources
├── 📋 README.md            # This comprehensive guide
└── 📁 .idea/               # IntelliJ IDEA project files
```

### 3. Start Learning!
1. **Begin with basics**: Navigate to `First Code/` directory
2. **Understand data types**: Explore `varNdataType/` examples
3. **Read documentation**: Check out PDF guides in `#NOTES/`
4. **Practice coding**: Modify and experiment with existing code

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

### 🔍 **Finding Examples**
- **Basic Concepts**: Look in numbered directories (`First Code/`, `varNdataType/`)
- **Theory Materials**: Educational PDFs in `#NOTES/` directory
- **Source Code**: `.java` files in `src/` subdirectories
- **Project Files**: IntelliJ IDEA configurations included

### 💻 **Running Code Examples**
